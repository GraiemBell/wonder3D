Wonder3D reconstructs highly-detailed textured meshes from a single-view image in only 2 âˆ¼ 3 minutes. Wonder3D first generates consistent multi-view normal maps with corresponding color images via a cross-domain diffusion model, and then leverages a novel normal fusion method to achieve fast and high-quality reconstruction.
